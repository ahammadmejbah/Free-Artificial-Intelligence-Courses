3. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-ai-for-business/">Introduction to AI for Business:</a>
  Peter Maynard, Director Program Management at Microsoft, explores what AI really is, why and how it will transform every business in every industry. Peter also uncovers how Microsoft technology is at the forefront of this transformation and show some scenarios, both present and future with respect to how this is helping business embrace digital transformation. The purpose of the course is to highlight how underlying Digital Transformation in a number of enterprises is simply an algorithm. This algorithm will determine the success of how that company will leverage its data in the future and if it will ultimately survive. Moving on from that as background, there will be then explored the types of steps that a company can take to win in the algorithm wars and things that they should be conscious of. In the course, there will be presented a range of examples of companies that are winning in Digital Transformation through AI.

  Would you like to learn about artificial intelligence and machine learning? What it is, what is its history, how it can impact you and the world around us? If that is so, this is the right course you, so go ahead and enroll. Artificial intelligence is any behavior by the machine that is considered intelligent by humans. People have been dreaming, writing myths and stories about intelligent machines for millennia. In the past 70 years artificial intelligence passed a long journey from being coined to one of the main drivers of the new industrial revolution. AI and automation is changing the world and industries in the pace like never before. The advances that were made in this field are helping inventing new cures, having knowledge of the world at our fingertips and being wealthier then ever in history. However, there are some dangers of ever increasing inequality and Matrix or Terminator like scenarios. This course will help you understand what AI is, how it developed through history. It will also help you critically think about the achievements and dangers of the AI in the future. We will examine how the rise of AI is touching every industry and what should businesses do to adapt and prepare. This course is not looking at algorithms and programming, but it is rather aimed at non-experts and non-computer scientist who want to understand the types and impacts of AI on their everyday or their businesses. The course contains combination of video lectures, and complementary reading materials as well as a list of recommended documentaries that will help you better understand artificial intelligence. The course is free and therefore there is nothing preventing you to enroll and start learning.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.
